# Smart Irrigation System

<details>
<summary><h2> Abstract </h2> </summary>
<br>
This project presents a simulated smart irrigation system developed using the Java programming language to model real-world agricultural water management. It simulates environmental factors such as soil moisture and rainfall using Javaâ€™s Random class, effectively representing the type of input typically gathered from sensors in IoT-based systems. The system dynamically responds to these simulated conditions: if the soil moisture drops below a defined threshold and no rainfall is detected, it triggers irrigation; otherwise, irrigation is withheld. This logic reflects the principles of intelligent control and automation in precision agriculture. The project is intended for educational and prototyping purposes, providing a software-based approach to test sustainable irrigation strategies without requiring physical hardware. By leveraging object-oriented programming, the system is modular and easily extendable to incorporate additional variables like temperature, humidity, and crop type. Overall, the project emphasizes the role of software in advancing agricultural innovation and serves as a foundation for future real-time, sensor-integrated smart irrigation systems.
